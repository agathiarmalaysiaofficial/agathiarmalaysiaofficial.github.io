                <p>To attain Eternal Bliss or Godly status a man must practice alms-giving and meditation. To practice
                    alms giving or charity he needs wealth. Even if he is wealthy, he should be generous. Even if he is
                    generous to carry out the noble acts of charity, he should have a conducive environment, place and
                    scrupulous followers. For all these he needs the great blessings of Guru Sri Agathiar.<br><br>
                    For meditation or prayer he must be aware us whom he must pray to and obtain the blessings. Even if
                    he has this awareness, he must be taught as to what and how he must seek in his prayer. He must
                    also be taught as to when and how long he must meditate or pray. Otherwise people will stumble
                    without knowing how to realize God.<br><br>
                    Hence a Preceptor or Teacher should be available to him who can guide the disciple with all His
                    rich experience. To be fortunate to have such a Preceptor or Guru the man needs the great blessings
                    of Guru Sri Agathiar.<br><br>
                    So his daily prayer to Guru Sri Agathiar must comprise of his humble request for Guru Sri
                    Agathiar’s blessings to practice charity and meditation with his submission that he realizes that
                    those two would be impossible without the holy blessings of Sri Agathiar.<br><br>
                    He must realize that without those two practices it would be impossible to attain Eternal Bliss. He
                    must surrender that even the prayer itself is the result of mercy shown by the Great Guru Sri
                    Agathiar and realize that all the above are only due to his own virtues or good deeds.<br><br>
                    With an intention to attain Godly status, some practice breathing exercise (Pranayama). When they
                    hold their breath for a long time they get acute stomachache, ulcer and will suffer from
                    hypertension (high blood pressure), indigestion and dysentery. There will be swelling in their
                    arms, legs, stomach and they will face untimely death leaving behind their wife and children as
                    orphans. The reasons for this are the absence of the true Guru in their life and the chasing ill
                    effects of their vices or bad deeds.<br><br>
                    Some in their eagerness to avoid death try many types of medicines, herbs etc., and assume that due
                    to its effect they would not die. Unfortunately they will have an unnatural death. Such people will
                    never listen to or will never take the advices of knowledgeable persons. This is again due to their
                    vices or bad deeds.<br><br>
                    Some will read Siddha's (Immortal Sages) writings on medicine and alchemy (science of converting
                    metals into gold) and will try to practice them. Such poems can never be understood for their real
                    meaning. Unaware of this truth such people will loose all their wealth in greed, become bankrupt
                    and therefore turn out to be laughing stock in the society. These people too will never take the
                    advices of the knowledgeable one. Even this is due to their vices or bad deeds.<br><br>
                    However it is true that there is a potion to enable one to conquer death or become immortal. One
                    can only know about it with the holy blessings of Lord Subramanyar or Sri Agathiar.<br><br>
                    There are 64 types of potion (medicine) or herbs that will not make a person immortal. Within our
                    body there is a potion drinking with which only one can conquer death. To experience this we must
                    devote ourselves to the Great Guru Sri Agathiar.<br><br>
                    Some tend to believe the preaching of fraudulent spiritual activists and start thinking that wife,
                    children, parents, wealth, life and the whole world are all illusions. Such fraudulent activists
                    will cheat and grab money from any innocent family man. God only knows what type of knowledge is
                    this!<br><br>
                    Whereas the true path to attain godly status is:<br>

                    1. To love and be affectionate to his parents.<br>

                    2. To respect the feelings of their spouse.<br>

                    3. To execute a parent’s duty for the well being of their children.<br>

                    4. To earn money in a righteous way.<br>

                    5. To use such money and wealth for the will being of the family members,friends, relatives and
                    practice alms giving to the poor around him.<br>

                    6. To pray or meditate by chanting the holy mantra "Om Agathisaya Nama" for 10 minutes both in the
                    morning and evening in order to be blessed with the Great Divine Knowledge and also the
                    determination to attain it through continuous prayer and meditation.<br><br>
                    Only the people with real sense and knowledge will make use of their family life and will not
                    develop any hatred for the worldly affair. They will enjoy the spiritual improvement. But they will
                    realize that it would take many years to enjoy the heavenly experience and maintain patience till
                    then.<br><br>
                    And by chanting “OM AGATHISAYA NAMA” all ill effects of one’s bad deeds will disappear. When they
                    disappear he shall possess the true knowledge and sense. Only with such knowledge we can realize
                    spirituatity and ultimately experience the Eternal Bliss. Hence only uninterrupted prayer or
                    meditation will help us attain the Godly status.<br><br>
